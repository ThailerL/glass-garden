# Glass Garden

Build cloud architecture by dragging load balancers, instance groups, and AWS services onto a canvas. Press play, use your app, and watch where requests go.

[Try it live](https://glass.garden/) - a two-minute guided tour starts you off.

Everything on your canvas is running real code, and your app talks to it the same way it would in production:

- instance groups run actual Node processes whose code you can edit
- Lambda functions with the standard handler shape, running in execution environments that scale to zero
- a Postgres server you connect to with the ordinary `pg` client
- an in-browser AWS region with S3, SQS, and DynamoDB you call with the ordinary AWS SDK

Click on any resource to pull up its metrics and logs, plus a live preview of whatever it's serving. Access between resources works by drawing edges between them.

It's all inside a WebAssembly VM in the tab, so there's nothing to install or sign up for. Nothing leaves your machine, and the whole thing is easily self-hostable.

## Self-hosting

To self-host with Docker, use this `compose.yaml`

```yaml
services:
  glass-garden:
    image: ghcr.io/thailerl/glass-garden:latest
    container_name: glass-garden
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

or run

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/thailerl/glass-garden:latest
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`. If you are not accessing the website from `localhost` (e.g. it is running on a separate server), then you will need to set up a reverse proxy with HTTPS as the app requires a secure context to work.

## Developing

Run the dev server and access it on port `3000`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ThailerL/glass-garden.git
cd glass-garden
npm install
npm run dev
```

If developing on a remote machine, you can get around the HTTPS requirement by running a browser in a container on the remote machine:

```sh
docker run -d --name=firefox --network host jlesage/firefox
```

Then open `http://<remote-host>:5800` and browse to `localhost:3000`.
